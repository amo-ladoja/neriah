First, think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md
The plan should have a list of to-do items that you can check off as you complete them
Before you begin working, check in with me, and I will verify the plan.
Then, begin working on the to-do items, marking them as complete as you go
Please, every step of the way, just give me a high-level explanation of what changes you make
Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and other relevant information.

IMPORTANT; Be visually design oriented, the design has to be according to precision always.
